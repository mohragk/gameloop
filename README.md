# Server Side Gameloop

## Description
A simple (Node) server side game engine that simulates circle-circle collisions and can render both circles and squares on the client side using basic CSS.

## Usage
Clone and use the command 'node index.js' to run server. In your browser, go to localhost:3000 and start clicking to spawn objects. Select between squares and circles from the dropdown box. Clicking an object removes it, but also spawns a new object.
